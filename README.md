## Hi 👋

My name is Antonio and I'm a **full-stack developer and blockchain enthusiast.** I have more than 15 years of experience in software engineering and web development, working in a wide variaty of projects: from small personal websites and side projects, to full-fledge web applications and complex projects built with microservices and REST APIs.

I'm currently working as a **developer advocate at [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com)**, a blockchain infrastructure company, where I create content about different blockchain protocols, build MVPs to showcase our product features, and engage with the community and customers to help them with our products.

I've also launch a few side projects like:

- 👨🏻‍💻 [SolidityTips](https://soliditytips.com) - Blog with specific tips about solidity and smart contracts.
- 🗓 [theLIFEBOARD](https://thelifeboard.app) - A weekly planner and habit tracker.
- 🚀 [QuickTalks](https://quicktalks.io) - Interviews with indie makers

You can find more about me in [my personal website](https://antonioufano.com) and [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/uf4no) 🤙
