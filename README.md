## Hi üëã

My name is Antonio and I'm a **full-stack developer and blockchain enthusiast.** I have more than 15 years of experience in software engineering and web development, working in a wide variaty of projects: from small personal websites and side projects, to full-fledge web applications and complex projects built with microservices and REST APIs.

I'm currently working as a **developer relations engineer at [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/)**, helping the team scale Ethereum with **[zkSync](https://zksync.io/)**

I previously worked as a developer advocate at [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com) a blockchain infrastructure company, where I created content about different blockchain protocols, built MVPs to showcase the product features, and engaged with the community and customers to help them with our products.
